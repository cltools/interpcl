**interpolate angular power spectra**

A very small package that does interpolation of angular power spectra for random
fields on the sphere.

Install with pip:

    pip install interpcl

Then import into your code:

    from interpcl import interpcl

For more information, see the [documentation].

Functionality is absolutely minimal at this point. Please open an issue on
GitHub if you want to see added functionality.
